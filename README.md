# Genetic Algorithm for Optimized Search Query Generation

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm** to generate optimized search queries based on a set of target keywords. The algorithm simulates the process of natural selection to evolve search queries that match given keywords, making them highly relevant for web searches or similar applications.

---

## Features

- **Fitness Function**: Evaluates the relevance of a query based on the presence of target keywords.
- **Population Initialization**: Generates a starting set of random search queries.
- **Crossover**: Combines parts of two parent queries to produce new "offspring" queries.
- **Mutation**: Introduces small, random changes in queries to explore the search space.
- **Genetic Evolution**: Iteratively improves the population of queries over several generations.

---

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: 
   - A population of random search queries is generated.
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: 
   - Each query is scored based on how many target keywords it includes.
3. **Selection**:
   - The top-performing queries are chosen as parents.
4. **Crossover and Mutation**:
   - Parents are combined and mutated to create a new generation of queries.
5. **Iteration**:
   - The process repeats for a fixed number of generations or until an optimal query is found.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

	2.	Install the required libraries:
This project uses Python standard libraries like random and string, so no external dependencies are required. However, for web scraping (if extended), libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup may be useful.
	3.	Run the script:

python first.py

Example Usage
	•	The script optimizes a search query based on the following target keywords:

target_keywords = ["machine", "learning", "algorithm"]


	•	Output: An optimized query relevant to the target keywords is generated and displayed for each generation.

Output Example

Generation 0: Best Query: 'machine learning', Fitness: 2
Generation 1: Best Query: 'machine learning algorithm', Fitness: 3
...
Final Optimized Search Query: machine learning algorithm

Files in the Project
	•	first.py: The main script containing the implementation of the genetic algorithm.

Future Enhancements
	•	Integrate a web scraper to fetch real-time relevance feedback from search engines.
	•	Expand mutation logic to generate more diverse queries.
	•	Implement multi-objective optimization for balancing keyword relevance and query length.
